### Additional features or tasks

Each Fellow must also define _one or more_ additional features or tasks they would like to add to their application. These features or tasks must be approved by an instructor and should make a meaningful improvement to your application. Below is a list of example features that could apply to any application. You may choose from the list below or come up with features or tasks that are more relevant to your specific application.

> **Note:** These features _do count_ for the rubric category "technical innovation", detailed above.

- Display errors to your user when they incorrectly fill out a form attempting to create or update a resource.
- Add a one-to-many table relationship to your database.
- Create middleware as part of your back-end application that validates for particular values when a resource is being created or updated.
- Use query parameters to filter your resource by different fields or qualities.
- When viewing all resources, break up your resources visually onto multiple pages.
- Visually allow for interacting with a second resource from the front-end.
- Allow for a list of "favorite" resources that are stored locally through [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
- Make your application responsive to different kinds of devices.

## Getting started

_Do not_ fork this repository. Instead, create your repository on GitHub and submit the URL directly to Canvas.

Then, follow the specifications above to create your application. Work with your instructors to approve your features before you begin working on them.
