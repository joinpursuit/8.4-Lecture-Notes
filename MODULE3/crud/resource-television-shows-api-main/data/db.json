Some have been found, their bodies dumped in the infamous Texas Killing Fields. Others have vanished and their cases gone cold. A year turns into five years, turns into a decade and it gets harder and harder for investigators to generate new leads. But, detectives quietly keep working. They work for the women whose stories are forgotten. They work for the families ripped apart by seemingly random attacks. DNA is tested as evidence, sketches are drawn of the missing, surveillance video of a suspect is circulated among media in hopes of closing a case. But when the missing go unreported, victims faces have long since faded from the headlines and even the best video can't identify a murderer, do their cases go unsolved forever?"

This hotel became widely known as the Heartbreak Hotel. Using rare archival footage, this documentary examines the Flight 800 disaster and explores the hotel – a haunting, abandoned time capsule of sorrow – with relatives, including a Texas man who publicly lived a personal hell. He lost his wife and two daughters but found the strength to start fighting. The documentary also introduces you to a woman who lost her fiancé aboard Flight 800. She converted her pain into a calling to help others survive grief."

That resulted in a stunning portrait of one of the sport's most iconic athletes and a celebrated team. \"The Last Dance\" follows the Bulls' 1997-98 season from start to finish, while also covering the rest of the chapters in Jordan's remarkable career. The 10-part docuseries follows the Jordan timeline from when he was an emerging star on his high school team to becoming a worldwide marketing force and cultural figure. The series takes its name from a phrase coined by then-Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who knew that the season would likely be the final run for the core members of that 1990s Bulls dynasty."

With dreams and ambitions and a heart ready to love, it was only a matter of time before she fell for someone. And fall she did; for her friend, Lee Soo (Ong Seong Wu). Little did she know that at the time, Lee Soo also had a crush on her. Unfortunately a simple misunderstanding kept them from confessing their feelings. A decade later, Woo Yeon still harbors a crush on Lee Soo. Working as a calligrapher, she still keeps in touch with her friend, but has never confessed her feelings for him. Oddly enough, the same could be said for Lee Soo, who is now working as a professional photographer. Though the two have taken turns having a crush on each other for over ten years, misunderstandings and missed timings have continued to keep them from becoming anything more than friends. With feelings ten years in the making, Woo Yeon and Lee Soo begin to realize their feelings for each other are becoming too strong to keep hidden. Has the time for their confessions finally come or will yet another misunderstanding keep them apart? “More Than Friends” is a 2020 romantic comedy drama directed by Choi Sung Bum."

Period drama about an ingénue abroad this is not. Instead, “Little Birds” is a modern tale of a woman losing and then finding herself down a mesmerizing rabbit hole. What Lucy discovers is a world in flux, a country quivering on the cusp of independence, populated by a myriad of characters including a provocative dominatrix, Cherifa Lamor (Yumna Marwan) who particularly captures Lucy’s imagination. “Little Birds” is a bold and subversive re-invention of melodrama for our times that takes the audience on a witty, moving and provocative journey towards freedom and independence."

Honey, a standard poodle, opens her living room for the group to come and support each other through the misery, mayhem and majesty that is being a pet. Honey also struggles with her own problems, such as her arranged (by her human) marriage with Chief, a sloppy St. Bernard who enjoys eating socks and licking himself. The group includes Shel, a sex-positive tortoise with intimacy issues and a knack for choosing unconventional partners; Tabitha, an aging Persian cat beauty queen, trying to adjust to life off the cat show circuit; The Gray One, a street smart cat who lives with about 30 other cats and has his one eye on Tabitha; Chico, a chonky, co-dependent and very naive cat; and the group's newest member, Diablo, an anxious, sweater-wearing terrier who has an obsessive compulsive disorder."

To get there, he and his predominantly all-female workforce must take risks. But after eight years of enormous success, Missguided crashed. They lost £26 million in 2018 and Nitin is now spending more than ever before to bring his business back to glory. This is an exploration of one of the UK’s fastest growing and most profitable industries: fast fashion. An industry that’s dominated by young entrepreneurial British Asians. Whilst there’s an extraordinary story to be told in the success and future plans of Missguided, there’s a cost beyond the price tag. The company must address the way it operates globally, and how to move forward in an everchanging, ever-ethical clothing industry."

Its vibrant jazz scene was a refuge for her, first as a star and then when she was forced out of the spotlight of New York. But it was also the site of some her greatest hardship and humiliation, a place where she was hounded by the law, arrested repeatedly, and sentenced to prison in a trial that made headlines. 6abc’s Tamala Edwards brings Billie and her hometown jazz mecca to life. See the clubs where Lady Day performed, the stages where she sang, the places she lived, and learn why one song – Billie Holiday’s signature tune – brought the wrath of racist lawmen down on her, leaving her with few places where she could feel safe, and few people to trust. Looking for Lady Day: the complicated relationship a genius jazz legend had with the city where she was born."

Outrage over an electricity crisis and a car tax fueled the grassroots movement, which quickly transformed into a larger than life political circus led by 'The Terminator' Arnold Schwarzenegger. A whopping 134 other candidates jumped into the race including media mogul Arianna Huffington, actor Gary Coleman, Hustler magazine’s Larry Flynt, adult film star Mary Carey, and college student Daniel Watts, who ran using money he won on ‘Wheel of Fortune.’ In just 10 wild weeks, Schwarzenegger overcame accusations of sexual misconduct and political inexperience to power his way to the top of the pack – ultimately ousting Davis to take on the biggest role of his life: California Governor. For the first time together, key players explain how this one-of-a-kind political moment unfolded. Hear from former Governor Gray Davis, former Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante, recall petition founder Ted Costa, citizen candidates Mary Carey and Daniel Watts, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, Schwarzenegger's communications director Rob Stutzman, Gray Davis's press secretary Steve Maviglio, historian Barry Bradford, and journalist Phil Matier."

Gilbert’s story was uncovered by researchers at the Northeastern University school of Law, who proved that he was beaten, tortured and lynched in a jail cell, all under the supervision of local law enforcement."

In this honest and uncompromising comedy, Paul and Ally are juggling full-time careers, aging parents, a mortgage, upheavals in their relationship and the unenviable curveballs of parenting their young children, Luke and Ava. When Ally's estranged father Michael appears on their doorstep, the family essentially takes on a third child three quarters of the time, but this one comes with baggage and opinions. Paul's own parents, Jackie and Jim, are on hand to help out, but their generation does parenting a little differently."

Jann's personal life is in shambles and she's convinced that the cure-all is to enlist a new manager to help rebrand her image. Filled with plenty of LOL moments, she embarks on a quest to return to greatness and go viral, but instead gets tangled in the pressures of her ‘real’ life. Jann is at the crossroads between who she was and who she wants to be. Can Jann stage a comeback, reclaim fame…and be there for the people who love her?"

Halfway across the world, Tuko is alone. After the death of her mate, Tuko becomes the last elephant in existence – what biologists call an endling. Her endling status summons to Earth a mysterious Alien who is on an intergalactic quest to save the last member of near-extinct species. After Tuko is collected, the Alien's ship malfunctions and sends it on a crash course with the farm where Julia (Kamaia Fairburn), Johnny (Edison Grant), Tabby (Michela Luci) and Finn (Cale Thomas Ferrin) live with their foster dad, Mr. Leopold (Neil Crone). Before crashing, the Alien releases all of its cosmic collection into the fields and wilderness surrounding the property. This kicks off a high-action life-altering mission to retrieve these fantastical creatures before the local police, Tuko's caretaker (Oyin Oladejo), or a secretive industrialist (Lisa Ryder) can. Along the way, four discarded teens discover that \"endling\" doesn't have to mean the end; it can also mean a new beginning."

      "description": "As the Roman Empire became weaker in the fifth century AD, a powerful military leader appeared on the eastern plains of Mongolia. Even his name is fearsome - Attila the Hun! Leading a vast army of horseback-riding warriors, Attila invaded the empire repeatedly, and it is his attack on the Romans and their allies in present-day France that is retold in the colorful television miniseries \"Attila.\" Taking the scattered history of the era as a starting point, the miniseries delves into the prophecies, the politics and the brutality of the times. The program proved a springboard for actor Gerard Butler, whose work as the Mongol leader led to a starring role in the sword-and-sandal movie epic 300."

At the time, the Centennial production was the most ambitious miniseries project ever attempted: nearly 100 speaking parts, four directors and five cinematographers, and multiple shooting locations across the USA combined to produce the massive 22-hour tale. Epic in its scope, Centennial portrays the development of the American western frontier from the late 18th century through the late 20th century, as seen through the eyes of families who eventually establish a town on the windswept plains of eastern Colorado. An all-star cast of television favorites populates this engrossing story."

This thoughtful and funny series explores the strange ways our past shapes our present. As Liam says, it's a heck of a lot cheaper than therapy."

But with his adopted teenage son, Amit, in serious need of daddy-advice, his cousin-slash-superfan-slash-stalker Rose popping up around every corner, and with most people thinking he's already dead, the journey back to stardom isn't going to be easy. Enter Tamzin, with her dreams of becoming an internationally respected manager. But with Maxxx as her only client, she certainly has her work cut out. Maxxx offers an outrageous, rude and cringe-inducing peek behind the pop world's curtain at the drugs, sex, insecurity and fragile narcissism of those who seek validation and meaning in all the wrong places."

Fourteen years later, Fried captures them reuniting for a series of shows in New York City that led to a triumphant run on Broadway.

Beginning in the Midwest, Farley moved his way through the Chicago improv and sketch comedy scene at IO and Second City. He broke through as a cast member of Saturday Night Live and later starred in several iconic big screen comedies. However, behind the over-the-top stage presence were insecurities that were deeply tied to his addictive personality. We'll examine Farley's tragically short life, both the amped-up force of nature in front of the camera and shy, childlike figure people knew behind the scenes. The two-hour special will utilize rare personal photos and videos, and feature new interviews with John Goodman, Al Franken, Kevin Nealon, Tom Arnold, Bobby Moynihan, Joel Murray, Kevin Farley, Brian Stack, Holly Wortell and Fred Wolf."

The winner of that challenge – as determined by a special guest judge – goes to the second round, in which he or she does battle against chef Flay. To make things a little more fair, the challenger has an advantage by being able to prepare a signature dish that is unknown to Bobby until the start of the round. Once he learns what the dish is, Flay must immediately come up with his own version. A panel determines the winner of the second round through a blind taste test. Food Network regulars Sunny Anderson, Anne Burrell and Giada De Laurentiis are among the judges appearing on the show."

Hoping for love and sunshine, she finds instead a dangerous, depraved, backward world that she resolves to change. All she has to do is kill her husband, beat the church, baffle the military and get the court onside. A very modern story about the past which encompasses the many roles she played over her lifetime as lover, teacher, ruler, friend, and fighter. Incorporating historical facts occasionally, the series stars Elle Fanning as Catherine, Nicholas Hoult, Phoebe Fox, Adam Godley, Gwilym Lee, Charity Wakefield, Douglas Hodge, Sacha Dhawan, Sebastian de Souza, Bayo Gbadamosi and Belinda Bromilow."

A beautiful, tough and gifted athlete, GINNY BAKER (Kylie Bunbury, “Under The Dome”) is vaulted into instant fame when she’s called up by the San Diego Padres to make her Major League debut. Like any rookie, Ginny must prove herself to her teammates. Foremost among them is MIKE LAWSON (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, “Franklin & Bash,” “NYPD Blue”), the team’s ruggedly handsome star catcher. There’s instant chemistry between them, although neither dares admit it. After all, Mike is captain of the team and a few of his players don’t even want Ginny on the field. One of the players watching Ginny’s back is center fielder BLIP SANDERS (Mo McRae, “Sons of Anarchy”), an old friend from the minor leagues and his wife EVELYN (Meagan Holder, “You Again,” “Bring it On: Fight to the Finish”). Guiding her is her agent/confidante, AMELIA SLATER (Ali Larter, “Legends,” “Heroes”). Amelia saw Ginny’s star potential early on and left her previous job as a Hollywood publicist to concentrate on the young phenom, bringing along her young assistant ELIOT (Tim Jo, “The Neighbors”). Although groomed for this moment by her demanding father, BILL BAKER (guest star Michael Beach, “Sons of Anarchy”), the end of Ginny’s improbable journey is the beginning of an almost impossible one: representing her gender as she embarks on a successful baseball career under the glare of the white-hot media spotlight."

A timer is set, and Ramsay will work around the clock to put these restaurants back on course. With only 24 hours to turn the restaurant around, he'll make the necessary changes that he sees fit - from re-interviewing the staff to see who makes the cut, to renovating the space and updating the menu with signature dishes and first-class service. Additionally, to help him with the task at hand, Ramsay will unveil his secret weapon - Hell on Wheels - a 70-foot-long semi-truck that unfolds into a state-of-the-art, completely self-sustaining mobile kitchen, where he'll re-invent the struggling restaurant's menu, and whip the staff into shape. Then, when the time is up, he'll present the launch of a revamped restaurant."

His odds of success at such a simple aim keep getting worse because Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions the men have to fly. More than the retreating Germans, the real enemy for Yossarian and his rag-tag bunch of friends is the bureaucracy of the military, inverting logic at every turn. The pinnacle of this is Catch-22, a military by-law which states that if you fly your missions, you’re crazy, and don’t have to fly them; all you have to do is ask. But if you ask not to, then you’re sane, and so you have to fly them."

Young Joon’s older brother, Lee Sung Yeon (Lee Tae Hwan), is a famous author who is in love with Mi So. Can Young Joon accept the fact that Mi So no longer wants to work for him or will he get the wrong idea? “What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim” is a 2018 South Korean drama series directed by Park Joon Hwa. It is based on a novel by Jung Kyung Yoon. A 2016 webcomic by Kim Young Mi also was based on the same novel."

Working from home, Richard has to contend with his personal demons, his teenage children, his unconventional parents, his eccentric therapist and his best friend, Pete, who is supposed to be offering him technical support but proves to be less than helpful. His high-flying wife, Karen, has work issues of her own, an over-eager assistant, a business in trouble and a perverse boss with a vivid fantasy life. What’s more, Karen is pressing hard for Richard to get a vasectomy, his supervisor seems out to undermine him, his father calls with terrible news and his own therapist has become worryingly anally-fixated. In the midst of all this and most troubling of all, one disastrous past decision is threatening not just his sanity but his personal safety.

And while they can't - and don't - win every trial, the pursuit of justice remains the priority until the final verdict is announced...and sometimes afterwards. Pursuing justice, however, often confronts the firm with serious ethical and moral issues of conscience. \"The Practice\" is one of television's most acclaimed series. The popular drama has won a Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Series, a Peabody Award, Viewers for Quality Television Award, was nominated several times for Emmy awards (winning twice) and received an American Bar Association Silver Gavel Award, among many others."

      "description": "To be a fan of The League on FXX, you don't need to know much about fantasy football, or sports at all. You just need to have friends that you hate. FXX's ensemble comedy follows a group of old friends in a fantasy football league who care deeply about one another - so deeply that they use every opportunity to make each other's lives miserable. The League was created by the husband-and-wife team of Jeff Schaffer (Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld) and Jackie Marcus Schaffer (Disturbia, Eurotrip) who serve as executive producers and directors. The League features an ensemble cast of rising actors/comedians. Mark Duplass (Humpday) plays \"Pete,\" the perennial league champ who is struggling to become an adult. Stephen Rannazzisi (Paul Blart: Mall Cop) is \"Kevin,\" a happily married father and commissioner of the league. Nick Kroll (Get Him to the Greek) plays \"Ruxin,\" who believes he is the smartest of the group but can't figure out how exactly the other guys are screwing him over. \"Andre,\" played by Paul Scheer (Human Giant), has continued to be the punching bag of the group since their high school days - a fact that hasn't changed despite the fact he is now a successful plastic surgeon. Jon Lajoie is \"Taco,\" Kevin's little brother, a part-time musician and full-time stoner with little interest in fantasy other than hanging with his buddies (whom he struggles to remember). Katie Aselton (The Freebie) plays \"Jenny,\" Kevin's wife and his better half - especially when it comes to Fantasy Football. An FX Networks Original Series."

Tiny Shoulders: Rethinking Barbie, featuring newly discovered footage and unprecedented access to the inner workings of a toy giant during Barbie’s biggest reinvention, surveys 60 years of women in popular culture through the lens of this 11.5 inch, Zelig-like plastic icon. Featuring interviews with Gloria Steinem, Roxane Gay, Peggy Orenstein, Mattel insiders and cultural historians, the documentary reveals, through both funny and crushing archival material, and fly-on-the-wall observations of Barbie’s current architects, the progression and regression in women’s fight for equality."

      "description": "The Dick Van Dyke Show is an American sitcom about a TV writer doing his best to juggle the responsibilities of life, both at work and at home, which initially aired on CBS from October 3, 1961 to June 1, 1966. The show was created by Carl Reiner and starred Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore. Totalling 158 episodes and five seasons, the show was also produced by Reiner, who wrote many episodes and played the part of Alan Brady. Reiner based the main character of Rob Petrie on himself and the Alan Brady character on his former boss Sid Caesar. Many of the show's plots were inspired by Reiner's experiences as a writer for Your Show of Shows (which starred Caesar). Dick Van Dyke won three Emmy's for his portrayal of Rob Petrie and Mary Tyler Moore (who would alter go on to star in her own self-titled Emmy-winning series) won two Emmy's playing Dick's irascible, Capri pants-wearing wife, Laura. The series was a launching pad for a slew of legendary comedians and artists, from director Garry Marshall and actress Rose Marie to comedians Jerry Farr and Don Rickles. Storylines deal with Rob Petrie and his two coworkers, Buddy and Sally, who write material for a television variety show. Mel Cooley, a balding straight man is the show's producer and the brother-in-law of Alan Brady, the show's seldom-seen star. Other stories focus on the home life of Rob and Laura, who live in suburban New Rochelle, New York. Frequently seen is their young son, Ritchie, as well as their neighbors, Jerry and Millie Helper."

      "description": "Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll centers on “Johnny Rock” (Denis Leary), lead singer of a legendary early 90’s New York band called The Heathens. Known for living up to their name, the band partied so long and so hard that even Keith Richards thought they needed to slow things down. The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped. Because lead guitarist Flash (John Corbett) found Johnny in bed with his wife. So the band became legendary for all the wrong reasons - like self-destructing sooner than any group in rock-n-roll history. 25 years later, the only thing bigger than Johnny’s ego is his prostate. The drugs he really needs now aren’t cocaine and marijuana – they’re Crestor, Cymbalta and Cialis. He’s out of work, out of money and out of show business options. That’s when a massively talented young singer named Gigi (Elizabeth Gillies) shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens’ only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio. Only this time, SHE’S the lead singer and Johnny’s just a behind-the-scenes songwriter. John Ales, Bobby Kelly and Elaine Hendrix round out the rest of this dysfunctional rock and roll family. The race is on to see who gets famous first - and for what reason. An FX Original Series."

The bar has always been run by, and passed down to, a Horace and a Pete, cousins or brothers. The bar serves no mixed drinks, only a few types of liquor and one brand of beer, Budweiser, in keeping with their commitment to having an old fashioned, traditional, family-owned bar. Horace, a divorced father of a grown daughter, lives in the apartment above the bar with Pete, who is single. Horace and Pete are battling with extended family members regarding the fate of the bar. Some want to sell, others do not. Various regulars come in and out, and take up their places in booths, or on barstools. The story unfolds over ten episodes, and takes place in the bar, and in the apartment above the bar. Ultimately it is a story of a family and the struggles and laughs that go into running a bar for generations."

Yoo Si Jin (Song Joong Ki), the leader of a Special Forces unit, meets trauma surgeon Kang Mo Yeon (Song Hye Kyo) in a hospital emergency room after Si Jin and his second-in-command, Seo Dae Young (Jin Goo), chase down a thief on their day off. Si Jin is immediately smitten with Mo Yeon, and he asks her out on a date. But Si Jin keeps getting called to duty when he is with Mo Yeon, and the two also realize that they have conflicting views about human life (he will kill to protect his country and she has to save lives at all costs). They decide to break off their budding relationship as a result. Dae Young also tries to break off his relationship with Army doctor Yoon Myung Ju (Kim Ji Won) because her father, Lt. General Yoon (Kang Shin Il), thinks Si Jin is a better match for his daughter. Si Jin and Dae Young are then deployed to the fictional war-torn country of Urk on a long-term assignment of helping the United Nations keep peace in the area. After repeatedly being passed over for a promotion because of her lack of connections, Mo Yeon gives up performing surgeries, loosening her principles somewhat to become a celebrity TV doctor and caring for VIP patients at the hospital. But when she refuses the sexual advances of the hospital chairman, Mo Yeon is picked to lead a medical team to staff a clinic in Urk! There, Mo Yeon unexpectedly reconnects with Si Jin. \"Descendants of the Sun\" is a 2016 South Korean drama series directed by Lee Eung Bok. The entire series was pre-produced prior to airing, which is a departure from how Korean dramas are typically produced. The stars and production team spent one month in Greece to film much of the series' storyline. The drama also is the first project for Song Joong Ki after finishing his mandatory two-year military service."

Kang Joo Eun (Shin Min Ah) was envied by every girl and desired by every boy in high school as the Daejeon Venus because of her pretty face and killer figure. Despite coming from a poor family, Joo Eun was determined to go to law school and become an attorney. At age 33, she has achieved her professional goals and has been in a stable relationship with her high school boyfriend, Im Woo Sik (Jung Gyu Woon), for 15 years. But she has let herself go over the years and is now overweight and often disregarded and overlooked by society and her coworkers. On the plane ride back from a quick business trip to the United States, Joo Eun has an embarrassing run-in with Kim Yeong Ho (So Ji Sub) and his two sidekicks, Jang Joon Seong (Sung Hoon) and Kim Ji Woong (Henry). Yeong Ho is a celebrity personal trainer who is involved in a scandal in the United States and forced to flee to Korea until things cool down. But his wealthy family has other plans for him. As soon as they discover that he is back in Korea, his grandmother appoints Yeong Ho as the new president of the family medical services company and prevents him from returning to the States. A lost purse causes Young Ho to reconnect with Joo Eun and witness another personal embarrassment for Joo Eun in the aftermath of being dumped by Woo Sik and finding out that he has been dating her new boss, Oh Soo Jin (Yoo In Young). As it seems to become a habit for Yeong Ho to bail Joo Eun out of trouble, can he also help her to reclaim her former looks? \"Oh My Venus\" is a 2015 South Korean drama series directed by Kim Hyung Suk."

High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy."

Between pervasive evil and countless temptations lurking beneath the city's glittery facade, L.A. has proven to be the ideal address for a fallen vampire looking to save a few lost souls and, in turn, perhaps redeem his own."

This incarnation of the famous starship is much larger than the one captained by James T. Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children. This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission – no longer limited to a mere five years – remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before."
